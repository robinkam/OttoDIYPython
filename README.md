# OttoDIYPython for ESP boards

This project is based on the [OttoDIYPython](https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoDIYPython) project and targeting to wireless control the OTTO using the WIFI capability on ESP32/ESP8266 development boards.

## How to run

1) Install Micropython firmware onto your microcontroller (recommend Wemos S2 mini)
2) Upload these files on to the board (recommend Thonny)
3) Run the main.py file from the REPL manually or just power up the OTTO (the main.py will be executed automatically)
4) Connect your smartphone or computer to the AP (default SSID: OTTO_on_ESP) created by the ESP board
5) Open the OTTO console page by visit http://192.168.4.1 in any web browser on your smartphone or computer that has connected to the OTTO.
6) Click buttons on the OTTO console page to explore the moves implemented in  [OttoDIYPython](https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoDIYPython) project.
